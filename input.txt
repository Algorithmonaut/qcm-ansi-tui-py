Which of the following is a characteristic of a B-tree?
3
It is a binary tree.
It is used in undirected graphs.
It is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
It is a type of linked list.

What is the main advantage of the MapReduce programming model?
2
It supports distributed transactions.
It allows for distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.
It provides real-time data streaming.
It ensures the security of data in a distributed system.

In the context of databases, what does ACID stand for?
4
Accuracy, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Dependency
Atomicity, Consistency, Information, Durability
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

Which of the following algorithms is used for finding the shortest paths in graphs?
1
Dijkstra's algorithm
Prim's algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm
Floyd-Warshall algorithm

What is the main purpose of a hash function in computer science?
1
To map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size
To sort data in ascending order
To compress data to save storage space
To encrypt data for secure transmission

Which machine learning algorithm is typically used for classification problems?
3
K-means
Linear regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Apriori algorithm

What does the term 'overfitting' mean in machine learning?
2
The model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.
The model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
The model has too few parameters relative to the number of training examples.
The model is too complex and captures noise instead of the underlying data pattern.

In computer networking, what does the term 'latency' refer to?
2
The amount of data that can be transmitted in a fixed amount of time
The time it takes for a data packet to travel from the source to the destination
The difference between the highest and lowest data transmission rates
The number of data packets lost during transmission

Which concept is essential for ensuring fault tolerance in distributed systems?
3
Load balancing
Data encryption
Replication
Resource allocation
